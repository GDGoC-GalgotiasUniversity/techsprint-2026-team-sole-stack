## 🎯 Problem Statement
*Addressing the friction in creative writing and academic research.*
* **Context:** Students, researchers, and creative writers often struggle with "blank page syndrome" and the time-consuming process of synthesizing vast amounts of information into coherent drafts.
* **Impact:** This leads to procrastination, reduced productivity, and a barrier to entry for aspiring writers and researchers who lack immediate guidance or feedback.

## 💡 Solution
*An intelligent, context-aware workspace powered by Google Technologies.*
1.  **AI-Powered Brainstorming:** Leverages Google's Gemini models to generate ideas, outlines, and varying perspectives on any topic instantly.
2.  **Smart Context Retention:** Maintains conversation history (via Vercel AI SDK) to provide continuity in long-form writing or complex research tasks.
3.  **Seamless Formatting:** Supports Rich Markdown and LaTeX for technical and academic writing, ensuring the output is ready to publish or submit.
